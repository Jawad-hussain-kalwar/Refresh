This is the plan for v 0.0.1 (first iteration) of an agentic system for codebase migration or modernization pipeline, that reads and understands the source codebase, gathers required information about it, runs it to verify it is working as intended, generate goldn test that would be the same tests for source and target to ensure identical behaviour, these tests include ui testing, API testing and more, then generate a migration plan and dependency mapping (if some source dependencies do not have equivalents in target stack, requred functionality have to be manually created), follow the migration plan and then, run the tests again for the migrated (target stack), if some tests fail, iterate upon those untill all tests pass, if success then give a go ahead for roll out to production:

## Simplified Migration Pipeline (Translation Focus)

### Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory
**Goal:** Map what needs to be translated

1.1. **Repository Scan**
   * Scan source repository for files, dependencies, and structure
   * Generate inventory of components to migrate
   * Output: `inventory.md`

1.2. **Dependency Analysis**
   * Extract all dependencies and their versions
   * Map source dependencies to target equivalents
   * Output: `dependency-mapping.md`

---

### Phase 2: Translation Setup
**Goal:** Define the translation rules and target structure

2.1. **Target Platform Definition**
   * Define target language/framework versions
   * Set up target project structure templates
   * Output: `target-config.md`

2.2. **Translation Rules**
   * Create mapping rules (source patterns → target patterns)
   * Define code transformation recipes
   * Output: `translation-rules.md`

---

### Phase 3: Automated Translation
**Goal:** Convert source code to target stack

3.1. **Code Translation**
   * Apply transformation rules to source files
   * Generate equivalent code in target language/framework
   * Preserve business logic and structure
   * Output: New repository with translated code

3.2. **Configuration Translation**
   * Convert build files, configs, and deployment specs
   * Translate environment variables and settings
   * Output: Target-compatible configuration files

---

### Phase 4: Basic Validation
**Goal:** Ensure translation didn't break core functionality

4.1. **Build Verification**
   * Attempt to build/compile the translated code
   * Fix basic syntax and import issues
   * Output: Buildable target codebase

4.2. **Structure Validation**
   * Verify all source components were translated
   * Check that key business logic files exist
   * Output: Translation completeness report

---

### Phase 5: Handoff Package
**Goal:** Prepare for ops team deployment

5.1. **Package Creation**
   * Create clean target repository
   * Include basic README and setup instructions
   * Add build and run scripts
   * Output: Deployable package

5.2. **Migration Report**
   * Document what was translated and how
   * Note any manual review areas
   * List next steps for ops team
   * Output: `migration-report.md`

---

## Simplified Agent Architecture

### Core Agents (5 total):

1. **Scanner-Agent**
   * Scans source repo, builds inventory
   * Maps dependencies to target equivalents

2. **Translator-Agent**
   * Applies code transformation rules
   * Converts source code to target language/framework

3. **Builder-Agent**
   * Tests if translated code compiles/builds
   * Fixes basic syntax issues

4. **Validator-Agent**
   * Checks translation completeness
   * Validates structure and key components

5. **Packager-Agent**
   * Creates final deliverable repository
   * Generates documentation and handoff materials

---

## Key Simplifications Made:

- **No Golden Master testing** (ops team handles testing)
- **No shadow traffic or canary** (ops team handles deployment)
- **No architecture mapping** (focus on direct translation)
- **No continuous quality gates** (basic build verification only)
- **No rollback planning** (ops team responsibility)
- **Single-shot migration** (not strangler fig)

This gives you a focused pipeline that does one thing well: translates code from source stack to target stack and hands off a working package to ops teams for proper testing and deployment.

Would you like me to detail any of these phases further or adjust the scope?
