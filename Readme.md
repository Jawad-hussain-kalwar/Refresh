# Refresh - Single Agent Codebase Migration System

## Overview
Refresh is an intelligent **single agent system** that automates codebase migration and modernization. Built with LangGraph, LangChain, and Google's Gemini AI, it uses **one primary agent** that orchestrates **8 specialized nodes** to analyze source code, understand architecture patterns, and generate production-ready migrated codebases.

## Architecture
The system operates as a **single agent** with **8 sequential nodes**:

```
1. Scope & Inventory â†’ 2. Golden Master Tests â†’ 3. Architecture Map â†’ 4. Target Platform Design â†’ 
5. Automated Transformation â†’ 6. Continuous Quality Gates â†’ 7. Parallel Verification â†’ 8. Cut-over & Rollback
```

Each node can internally loop with multiple LLM calls and specialized tools, but the overall system remains one cohesive agent with shared state and context across all phases.

## Key Features
- **Single Agent Architecture**: One intelligent agent managing the entire migration pipeline
- **8 Specialized Nodes**: Each node handles a specific phase of the migration process
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Uses AI to make runtime decisions about analysis tools and approaches
- **Quality-Driven Flow**: Automatic retry loops and quality gates ensure reliable transformations  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Analyzes and migrates codebases across multiple programming languages and frameworks
- **Production-Ready Output**: Generates complete, tested, and deployable target codebases

## Supported Languages & Frameworks
The agent dynamically detects and adapts to various technologies including:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby
- **Web Frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular, Django, Flask, Express.js, Spring Boot, ASP.NET
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite
- **Package Managers**: npm, pip, Maven, Gradle, NuGet, Composer

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Git
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Refresh

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage
```bash
# Analyze and migrate a local codebase
python main.py --source /path/to/your/project --target python-fastapi

# Run with specific analysis depth
python main.py --source /path/to/project --target react-nextjs --depth comprehensive
```

## Technology Stack
Built with:
- **LangGraph**: Single agent orchestration and node workflow management
- **LangChain**: Tool integration and prompt management
- **Google Gemini**: AI analysis and decision making
- **Tree-sitter**: Multi-language code parsing

## Migration Pipeline Output

The single agent system produces a complete production-ready migration through 8 specialized nodes:

### 1. Scope & Inventory
- Complete project inventory and dependency analysis
- Architecture pattern identification
- Migration complexity assessment

### 2. Golden Master Test Suite  
- Comprehensive behavioral test suite
- UI, API, and integration tests
- Tests that work identically on source and target systems

### 3. Architecture Map
- Detailed architectural documentation
- Component relationship diagrams
- Integration point identification

### 4. Target Platform Design
- Target platform specifications
- Migration roadmap and strategy
- Dependency mapping and translations

### 5. Automated Transformation
- Complete code transformation to target platform
- Configuration and build file conversion
- Maintaining business logic and functionality

### 6. Continuous Quality Gates
- Build validation and syntax checking
- Dependency verification
- Quality reports with go/no-go decisions
- **Loop**: Returns to Node 5 if quality gates fail

### 7. Parallel Verification (Master Test Suite)
- Execute golden master tests on transformed code
- Behavioral equivalence verification  
- Divergence detection and reporting
- **Loop**: Returns to Node 5 if tests fail

### 8. Cut-over & Rollback Preparation
- Production readiness validation
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Rollback planning and documentation
- Final deployment package creation

## Contributing
This project follows a single agent architecture. When contributing:
- Maintain the single agent design pattern
- Each node should be self-contained but share state
- Use consistent tool binding patterns
- Ensure quality gates and retry mechanisms

## Design Principles
- **Single Agent Orchestration**: One agent manages the entire pipeline with full context
- **Node-Level Modularity**: Each node handles specific responsibilities
- **Quality-Driven Flow**: Continuous validation with automatic retry loops
- **Shared Context**: State and learning maintained across all nodes
