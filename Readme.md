# Refresh - Codebase Transformation System

## Overview
Refresh is an intelligent **single agent system** that automates codebase transformation and modernization. Built with LangGraph, LangChain, and Google's Gemini AI, it uses **one primary agent** that orchestrates **8 specialized nodes** to analyze source code, understand architecture patterns, and generate production-ready migrated codebases.

## Architecture
The system operates as a **single agent** executing a pipeline of **7 specialized nodes**. After an initial analysis, it works on generating tests and mapping the architecture in parallel before proceeding through the transformation and verification stages. The final output is the 8th item: a fully migrated codebase.

The high-level flow is:
1.  **Scope & Inventory Generation** provides initial insights.
2.  This feeds into both:
    *   **2. Language Agnostic Test Suite**
    *   **3. Architecture Map Generation**
3.  The pipeline then proceeds sequentially from **4. Target Platform Design** through to **7. Re-run Language Agnostic Test Suite**, with built-in quality loops.

Each node can internally loop with multiple LLM calls and specialized tools, but the overall system remains one cohesive agent with shared state and context across all phases.

## Key Features
- **Single Agent Architecture**: One intelligent agent managing the entire transformation pipeline
- **8 Specialized Nodes**: Each node handles a specific phase of the transformation process
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Uses AI to make runtime decisions about analysis tools and approaches
- **Quality-Driven Flow**: Automatic retry loops and quality gates ensure reliable transformations  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Analyzes and migrates codebases across multiple programming languages and frameworks
- **Production-Ready Output**: Generates complete, tested, and deployable target codebases

## Supported Languages & Frameworks
The agent dynamically detects and adapts to various technologies including:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby
- **Web Frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular, Django, Flask, Express.js, Spring Boot, ASP.NET
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite
- **Package Managers**: npm, pip, Maven, Gradle, NuGet, Composer

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

## Transformation Pipeline Output

The single agent system produces a complete production-ready transformation through 7 specialized nodes, resulting in the final migrated codebase:

### 1. Scope & Inventory Generation
- Complete project inventory and dependency analysis
- Architecture pattern identification
- Transformation complexity assessment

### 2. Language Agnostic Test Suite  
- Comprehensive behavioral test suite
- UI, API, and integration tests
- Tests that work identically on source and target systems

### 3. Architecture Map Generation

## Contributing
This project follows a single agent architecture. When contributing:
- Maintain the single agent design pattern
- Each node should be self-contained but share state
- Use consistent tool binding patterns
- Ensure quality gates and retry mechanisms

## Design Principles
- **Single Agent Orchestration**: One agent manages the entire pipeline with full context
- **Node-Level Modularity**: Each node handles specific responsibilities
- **Quality-Driven Flow**: Continuous validation with automatic retry loops
- **Shared Context**: State and learning maintained across all nodes
